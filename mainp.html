<p>When putting together a baseball team, several components need to come together to maintain success. On one side of Baseball, we have teams like the Yankees and Dodgers who always seem to be competing, while teams like the Diamondbacks or Athletics always seem to be “bad”. While there’s no direct correlation between teams that succeed or not when you look at the underlying data of a franchise you can see where teams go wrong every time.

<p>When beginning to dissect all the different data I turned to interview my father, Brian Marcus who has been in the business world his entire life. Although not in the baseball world, I was looking for some interpretation of the data through a professional business lens.


<p>“Lack of attendance is a proxy for a team that is not focused on growing its brand. Attendance is like online traffic if you don't spend money to build your brand, people will not come to visit your website. Relating to baseball, teams will attract crowds when they win, and you can’t win if you’re not willing to spend what it takes," Marcus said.

<p> The support of fans is what allows teams to generate revenue through ticket sales, merchandise, and advertising. This revenue is then used to pay players and other team staff, which in turn helps to attract more fans.

<p>One of the main ways that teams generate revenue is through ticket sales. Fans purchase tickets to attend games, which provides teams with a steady source of income. In addition to tickets, teams also generate revenue from the sale of team merchandise such as hats, jerseys, and other items. This merchandise is popular with fans, who often want to show their support for their favorite team.

<p>As we can seefrom the chart above, The Dodgers stand comfortably at the top of team payroll with the Cardinals close behind. It makes sense that the Dodgers have so much to spend year in and year out goven their teams history and success. 

<p>But while baseball teams rely on fans to generate revenue, they also need to have a winning team in order to attract fans. Winning teams tend to draw more fans to games, which leads to increased revenue through ticket sales and merchandise. In this way, the success of the team is closely tied to the support of the fans.

<p> One team I find interesting based on the data is the St. Louis Cardinals because in recent years, they have struggled to consistently perform at a high level. Despite having the second highest payroll in the league, the Cardinals have struggled to win their division and have had mixed results in the playoffs. 

  <p>There have been various factors that have contributed to their struggles, such as injuries to key players, inconsistent performances from key players, and challenges in their division. Despite these challenges, the Cardinals have a dedicated fan base and are known for their resilience, and they will likely continue to work hard to improve and achieve success in the future.

  <p>There are several Major League Baseball (MLB) teams that have loyal fanbases despite not spending a lot of money on player salaries and team resources. These teams often rely on strong team culture, a rich history, and a strong connection to their local community to attract and retain fans.

<p> This chart above shows a direct connection between team payroll and the fans per game. Spending money is just part of the game and if a team is unable to do so they suffer the consequences.

  <p>On the other hand, there are also teams that do have the financial resources to spend on top talent, but still struggle to draw and maintain a loyal fan base. This can be due to a variety of factors, such as a lack of success on the field, a negative reputation within the league, or a lack of connection to the local community. 

  <p>The success of a team and its ability to attract and retain fans depends on a combination of factors, including financial resources, team culture, and the team's connection to its community.

<p>In order to attract fans, teams need to have a good product on the field. This means investing in players. If a management doesn't want to spend, it may be for a good reason, but it could easily lead to a loss of fans. 

<p> Overall, from all of these graphs, it can be seen that there is some coorelation with fan attendance and the amount a team invests in players. So while it's not a direct coorelation, in some cases if you invest big, everything else will start to follow.
